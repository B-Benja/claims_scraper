# claims_scraper
A simple Python script to scrape the number of independent and dependent claims from Google Patents.

The script takes input data from a CSV file (in the same format as the sample input.csv), extracts the number of independent and dependent claims for each patent, and saves the results in output.csv. Any errors encountered during the process are reported in errors.csv.

### Usage
1. Make sure your input data is in the same format as the sample input.csv.
2. Run the **claims_scraper.py** script.
3. The script will process the input data and save the results in output.csv. Errors, if any, will be reported in errors.csv.
